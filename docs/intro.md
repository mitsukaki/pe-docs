# About
Pose Engine is a tool for dynamically building and expanding a vrchat avatar's locomotion. You can add "poses", such as sitting, laying down, or even flying, to your avatar, and switch between them with ease. The tool is designed to be easy to use, and requires no coding or animator skills to use. In addition, it's non-destructive, meaning it doesn't damage your underlying avatar, and can be safely removed at any time.

Much thought was given to providing everything in an simple package, so that creators can focus on creating, rather than learning how to use the tool. The tool is also designed to be extendable, so that it can be pushed even further by those who want to experiment with it, and create things we haven't even thought of.

:::caution Pose Engine is in Early Development
Pose Engine is still in early development. While it's functional and actively used by avatar creators, there can be bugs, and documentation is lacking. Please report any issues you encounter, and feel free to ask for help in the [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/ew49tn6pR2).

## Features
### Locomotion Features
- **Preserves Avatar Locomotion**: Pose Engine can be used to add custom locomotion systems to your avatar, while preserving the original locomotion system.
- **Custom Poses**: Easily add custom poses to your avatar, and switch between them with an automatically generated menu.
- **Blended Poses**: Create complex poses by blending multiple poses together. The blending is parameter-based, and can be controlled by menus, other animators, and more.

### Framework Features
- **Easy-to-Use**: Each component and is designed to be easy to use, and requires **no coding or animator skills** to use.
- **Extendable**: A simple but powerful API is provided, to allow the framework to be pushed even further. The non-destructive nature of the tool allows for easy & care-free experimentation.
- **Non-Destructive**: Pose Engine does not directly modify your avatar in any way. It can be easily removed at any time.
- **Modular Design**: The tool is designed to be modular, so that you can use only the parts you need, and leave out the rest. Additionally this makes it useable for prefab and asset creators.
